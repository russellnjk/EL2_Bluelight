# EL2_Bluelight
Curve fitting and simulation for EL2-bluelight inducible/repressible system

EL222 protein dimerizes in blue light and can be used to induce or repress genetic circuits.

This study used experimental data to determine the parameters of the circuit and simulate expression output for a given light input pattern.
